\section{Introduction}

The goal is to create a simple mixed-layer plus geostrophic eddy model which can be used to assess the amount of trapping expected in the surface mixed layer.

The mixed layer models considered will be a damped-slab model, and a few of the other models from \cite{elipot2009-os}.

We want to think of this as an equivalent barotropic model for the QG portion---that is, a single baroclinic mode, with no pressure at the bottom boundary. Typical first baroclinic modes in the ocean have an equivalent depth of 80 cm in the ocean. So, we want to maintain the following integral,
\begin{equation}
    80 \textrm{ cm} = \frac{1}{g \pi^2} \left[ \int_{-D}^0 N(z) \, dz \right]^2
\end{equation}{}
when we create our toy density profile.

So let's do the following model: exponential decay in the interior, pycnocline near the surface
\begin{equation}
    N^2(z) = N_0^2 \exp \left[2 \left( \frac{z+D}{L} + \ln \frac{N_b}{N_0} \right)\left( \frac{1-\tanh\left(\frac{z-z_p}{\delta_p}\right)}{2} \right) \right]
\end{equation}{}
where the $\tanh$ function gives us the change to the mixed layer. The whole term is 1 at $z=-D$, and 0 at $z=0$. \textbf{This profile has a mixed layer, but no jump in density crossing the transition layer.} See figure \ref{modes-no-deltarho}

\begin{figure}

  \caption{Basic stratification profile with \emph{no} density jump after the mixed layer. Interior modes 1 and 2 are shown, blue and red.}
  \label{modes-no-deltarho}
\end{figure}

So now let's add a classic little pycnocline as a $\sech^2(z)$ that we can use to tune the density jump.
\begin{equation}
    N^2(z) = N_0^2 \exp \left[ \left( \frac{z+D}{L} + \ln \frac{N_b}{N_0} \right)\left( 1-\tanh\left(\frac{z-z_p}{\delta_p}\right) \right) \right] + N_\textrm{ml}^2 \sech^2 \left(\frac{z-z_p}{\delta_p}\right)
\end{equation}{}
The value $N^2_ml$ can be set with the required change in density across the jump. Integrating the $\sech^2(z)$ function (to get $\rho$) gives you a $\tanh(z)$ function with amplitude 2. So,
\begin{equation}
    N_\textrm{ml}^2 = \frac{g \Delta \rho }{2 \rho_0 \delta_p}
\end{equation}{}
is the appropriate amplitude to set. Look at Latmix data from the summer time in the Sargasso, and it seems like $\Delta \rho$ can certainly be on the order of 2 $kg/m^3$ or even more. Check out figure \ref{modes-3-deltarho}---the surface looks quite a bit different, but also realistic!
\begin{figure}
\vspace{-30pt}
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{ModesWithDeltaRho3}
  \caption{Basic stratification profile with a sizeable density jump after the mixed layer. Interior modes 1 and 2 are shown, blue and red.}

\begin{figure}
\vspace{-30pt}
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{ModesWithDeltaRhoComparisonDensityMatched}
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{ModesWithDeltaRhoComparisonSSHMatched}
  \caption{Comparison of the lowest interior modes where the density anomaly is assumed to match (left) and where the SSH is assumed to match (right). }
  \label{ModesWithDeltaRhoComparison}
\end{figure}

Now let's check out how the lowest mode compares in these two scenarios--one without a $\Delta \rho$ jump across the transition layer, and the other with a sizeable jump. See figure \ref{ModesWithDeltaRhoComparison}. In the left panel, we match the density anomaly in the interior---and then you can see that the $(u,v)$ modes (and therefore also SSH) differ substantially depending on whether $\Delta \rho$ is larger or not. The panel on the right shows the opposite situation---now SSH is made to match, and you can see how the velocity and density profiles below the transition layer differ substantially.

I think the more realistic scenario is the first one---the density anomaly is fixed in the interior, and the mixed layer and transition layer undergo some sort of change (or the eddy moves to a new location), and then the surface velocity changes accordingly. Pete---thoughts?


It might be worth considering how the \textbf{second} interior mode responds to near surface changes in stratification. It is the second mode that is most strongly affected in the sense that it carries.
